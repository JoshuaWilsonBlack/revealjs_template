# NZILBB web slides template

This is a template for use with Quarto to generate web slides (i.e. revealjs
presentations) with NZILBB logos.

The slides will be updated after NZLS 2024.

## How to use this template

Run `quarto use template nzilbb/revealjs_template` in your terminal. It is easy to
do this from within RStudio. Just use the 'Terminal' tab in the pane at the 
bottom of the RStudio window.

This will set up a new directory for your presentation. The file `index.qmd` is
the one you should edit. You can rename it if you like, but 'index' is the best
name if you want to host your slides online.

More information on using this template is in the `index.qmd` file.
