# NZILBB web slides template

This is a template for use with Quarto to generate web slides (i.e. revealjs
presentations) with NZILBB logos.

The slides will be updated after NZLS 2024.

## How to use this template

Run `quarto use template nzilbb/revealjs_template` in your terminal. It is easy to
do this from within RStudio. Just use the 'Terminal' tab in the pane at the 
bottom of the RStudio window.

This will set up a new directory for your presentation. The file `index.qmd` is
the one you should edit. You can rename it if you like, but 'index' is the best
name if you want to host your slides online.

Two title page logos are given, one with the Marsden fund logo and one without.
See the comments in at the top of `index.qmd` for instructions on how to switch
between the two logo options. You may need to modify the size of the logos 
depending on the length of your title, subtitle, author details etc.

More information on using this template is in the `index.qmd` file.
